# ðŸ’“ Heart Stroke Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the **risk of heart stroke** based on medical attributes. It uses a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to evaluate user inputs and determine if a person is at high or low risk of heart disease.

## ðŸ§  Model Used

- **KNN Classifier**
- Trained using a heart disease dataset (such as UCI or Kaggle-based)
- Preprocessing includes:
  - Label encoding of categorical variables
  - Feature scaling (via StandardScaler)
  - One-hot encoding for model compatibility
